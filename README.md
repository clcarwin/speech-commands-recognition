## Speech Commands Recognition
Single word speech recognition using PyTorch

### Data source
Warden P. Speech Commands: A public dataset for single-word speech recognition, 2017. Available from http://download.tensorflow.org/data/speech_commands_v0.01.tar.gz

__Note__: Since the unzipped data is > 2GB in size, I have only uploaded a small sample of the entire dataset. In each folder, there are only ten files (instead of 1000+). 

### Speech Commands Data Set v0.01
> This is a set of one-second .wav audio files, each containing a single spoken
English word. These words are from a small set of commands, and are spoken by a
variety of different speakers. The audio files are organized into folders based
on the word they contain, and this data set is designed to help train simple
machine learning models.
